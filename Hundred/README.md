A game where two players (a human and a computer) compete to gain a total score of over 100 by rolling a die. On each player's turn, they can roll as many times as they like and the score on the die is added to the total score. But if a play throws a one, they lose their score for that turn.

The computer decides whether to continue rolling a die or stop for that turn through a random generator in order to mimic a human intelligence. This is where I see the prospect for improving this game.
