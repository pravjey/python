In ml-ecoli.py, the publicly available Ecoli dataset is cleaned and an machine learning analysis is undertaken to rank the different features in order of importance, the predictive accuracy rate based on the number of features used and which features produce more accurate results.

The algorithm for cleaning is explained at https://pravinjeyaraj.wordpress.com/2019/05/04/cleaning-the-ecoli-dataset-using-python/
