This folder contains the Python files for my MSc in Data Science project. The aim of the  project was to collect data about the different UK Government cats' Twitter accounts, using the Twitter API, and undertake various forms of analysis.

timeTest.py / AnalyseLibraries.py - an analysis of the time taken to access the maximum number of followers for a given Twitter account using different Python libraries. Findings discussed at https://pravinjeyaraj.wordpress.com/2019/07/23/so-you-want-to-access-twi catter-data-using-python/

DataCollect.py / govcats.py - a descriptive and graphical analysis of the number of followers, number of friends, number of tweets, number of likes and creation date for each government cat account. Findings discussed at https://pravinjeyaraj.wordpress.com/2019/09/23/who-is-the-most-popular-government-cat/

DataCollect.py - a program to collect and store lists of the most recent followers, friends, twensets of each government cat and lists of the profile descriptions and stated locations for each of the most recent follower of each government cat.

AnalysisFollowers.py - a program to create a graph/network of the global network for the UK government cats and the most recent followers and friends and to identify the most central accounts in the global network.

AnalysisFollowers2.py - a program to collect basic information about the most central accounts in the global UK government cat  network.

AnalysisDescript.py - a programe to develop an understanding of the most recen t followers of each government cat, based on textual analysis of the profile descriptions

AnalysisLocations.py - a programe to develop an understanding of the most recent followers of each government cat, based on textual analysis of the stated locations

AnalysisTweets.py - a programe to develop an understanding of main topics or main mentions of each government cat, based on textual analysis of their tweets

AnalysisTweets2.py - a program to visualise the key relationships of the government cats, based on the textual analysis produced in AnalysisTweets.py
