These files comprise my own analysie of a dataset of tweets posted by ISIS supporters. It was made available on Kaggle by Fifth Avenue, a digital agency, who is involved in tackling extremism. The original dataset and data description is available at https://www.kaggle.com/fifthtribe/how-isis-uses-twitter.

My analysis was undertaken using Python and the pandas library

It comprises two files:

isistweets.py involves an initial exploration in order to obtain basis information about the dataset

isistweets2.py involves plotting the distribution of tweets according to number of followers and number of statuses at time of download as as a principal component analysis.
